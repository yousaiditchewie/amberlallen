For my second birth experience, I had been praying for 3 things:That I would go into labor before my due dateThat my labor would be relatively quick but not too quick because I was GBS positive and needed antibiotics during labor.That I would not have a c-section because I wanted to avoid surgery and the recovery that came with it.And by God's grace all of these things came to fruition...sort of. It all started the night of Thursday, August 23rd, 10 days before my due date. I started having contractions that felt stronger than Braxton Hicks and they were 30 minutes apart. But they never got closer together, so we went to sleep. The next day Harrison and I went to the park for a mommy play date. I was having contractions every hour or so while we were there and the rest of the day. Again they never got closer together. This same pattern continued for the next two days and the contractions got stronger. They got more painful to the point where I had to moan and breath through them and get into a comfortable position, but they never got closer than 10 minutes. This meant that I did not sleep much at all Friday and Saturday night.I did some research and I believe what I was experiencing was prodromal labor, which is early labor. It is real labor, trust me those contractions were painful, but it can go on for days and weeks without progressing or dilating your cervix. I was discouraged by the fact that these contractions were getting so painful but potentially weren't causing me to progress.We were trying to hold off going to the hospital before my Mom flew in Monday night, but on Sunday night I could not face another sleepless night without knowing if my labor was progressing.As an aside, we did not know for sure who would watch Harrison if I went into labor before my mom got into town. We had a handful of friends on call but I wouldn't really be convenient for any of them to watch him because they have kids of their own. I was definitely a little anxious about it because I don't like leaving Harrison with anyone but family. The Lord did something amazing and provided someone to watch Harrison that same Thursday night I started having contractions. We met her at connect group, she lived in our apartment complex and she had previously watched Harrison in child care at church! She said she would watch Harrison if we needed her to. How crazy is that. Leave it to God provide the perfect person at the last minute. I believe that alleviated some of my anxiety which then allowed my body to go into labor.So anyway Sunday night we called our new friend/neighbor to see if she'd stay at our apartment while we went to the hospital to get checked out. It was 10:30 at night so Harrison was sleeping. I was sure that I wouldn't be dilated and that they'd send us home. We told our friend that we'd probably be back in a few hours.I have not gone into labor on my own before without being induced and so this was my first time walking into a hospital possibly in labor and through the emergency room. I was still having contractions 10 minutes apart but it wasn't the whirlwind experience I had imagined since there was a lot of downtime between the contractions.It was a slow night in the ER except for Labor & Delivery. We were the 5th OB patient in a row. The staff and nurses attributed it to the full moon. They said that L&D is usually full on a full moon. It took us an hour to get into a room around 11:30PM. I thought it was odd that they didn't just check me in triage, especially since my contractions were so far apart and it was doubtful I was in full on labor.But nonetheless they checked us into a room. The nurse did indeed seem doubtful that I would be far along, but when she checked me I was nearly 5cm, halfway there! She said even though my contractions were far apart they were working hard. Ouch, no wonder they were so painful. She said I could probably do this naturally if I wanted to, which I thought was encouraging. I was shocked and we were definitely not leaving the hospital.And y'all, I sobbed. We had put Harrison down and left him without thinking it would be our last time together as a family of 3. It was probably better that way. If I knew it was the last time I probably would've sobbed as we left. But instead I sobbed in our L&D room as the full reality of it all washed over me. The emotional release probably helped my labor along nicely.I wanted to go as long as I could without an epidural to help prevent the need for any interventions. I wanted to give my body a chance to do its thing. I did have the exhaustion from not sleeping the last few nights working against me and here we were about to labor through the night. I was not excited about that. Hospitals aren't the most comfortable to labor in either since they strap you to an IV and fetal monitors. My contractions got more intense and they moved from across my lower abdomen to my lower back between my hips. I thought for sure my hips were breaking in half. I'm also not sure if that was back labor but it was painful. I progressed to an 8, but y'all my contractions never got closer than 10 minutes apart. Not even during transition and pushing like they are supposed to. So going from an 8-10 was taking a long time. I was so tired and the contractions were so painful that I finally got an epidural at, I think, 6 in the morning.I was bummed that I was not fully dilated before Harrison woke up. I didn't want him to wake up without us. He was in great hands but I didn't want him to wonder where mommy and daddy were, especially because we didn't get to say goodbye.The next few hours were pretty uneventful and I had to lay in bed and couldn't feel anything. My right leg was more numb than my left. Like soooo numb the epidural took a while to wear off in my right leg afterwards.Anyway, since our OB office was a group practice it was a toss up who would be on call that day. I really liked my original OB and a few of the others. The OB on call that day was not my original OB but she was still great. She broke my water at some point after getting the epidural to help things along. Actually not much amniotic fluid came out and she thought maybe it was all tucked behind baby. When he did finally come out not much fluid came with him which makes me wonder if his fluid was low all along. We hadn't gotten it checked, which is odd in hindsight.At around 9AM I was completely dilated. I was excited to meet Henry but nervous for pushing because pushing Harrison out had taken 2 hours. But while we were doing practice pushes the nurse told me to stop because he was about to come out. The doctor was still scrubbing up and getting ready. We were chatting and joking, it was actually really relaxing. Thank you, epidural!They had to give me pitocin to get my contractions closer together for pushing. I think I pushed once or maybe twice but it was so much easier than the first time and out came Henry Joel at 9:22AM. His face was a little swollen so his lips were huge. We didn't have him weighed right away since we were doing skin to skin but I could tell he was smaller than Harrison was, especially his head. No wonder it was easier to push him out. He ended up weighing 7lbs 12oz and was 19.5 in long.All in all it was a really smooth labor and delivery and we are so grateful. Thank you Lord for answered prayers.
